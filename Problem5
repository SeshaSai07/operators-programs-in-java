Question:
Given two positive integers a and b. Your task is to perform right shift bitwise operation on it as given i.e. a>>b.

Examples:

Input: a = 5, b = 2
Output: 1 
Explanation: (101)2 >> 2 = (001)2
Input: a = 4, b = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: (100)2 >> 1 = (010)2

Solution:
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        int b = sc.nextInt();
        // Perform operation and print
        int c = a >> b;
        System.out.print(c + " ");
        
    }
}
