Question:
Given three integers a, d and n. Where a is the first term, d is the common difference of an A.P.  Calculate the nth term of A.P. 
The nth term is given by an = a + (n-1)d

Examples: 

Input: a = 5, d = 2, n = 5
Output: 13
Explanation: anth = a + (n-1)d = 5 + (5-1)*2 = 5 + 8 = 13
Input: a = 10, d = 10, n = 101 
Output: 1010 
Explanation: anth = a + (n-1)d = 10 + (101-1)*10 = 10 + 1000 = 1010.

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int nthTerm(int a, int d, int n) {
        // code here
        int nthTerm = a + (n - 1) * d;
        return nthTerm;
    }
}
