Question:
Given three integers, a, r and n. Where a is the first term, r is the common ratio of a G.P. and r is equal to 2.  Calculate the nth term of GP.

The nth term is given by an = a * r(n-1), where r = 2.

Examples:

Input: a = 2, n = 10
Output: 1024
Explanation: an = a * rn-1 = 2 * 210-1 = 1024

Solution:
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.math.*;

class Solution {
    public static void solve() {
        Scanner scn = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scn.nextInt();
        int n = scn.nextInt();
        int r = 2;
        // Compute and Print
        n = a * (int)(Math.pow(r , n - 1));
        System.out.print(n + " ");
    }
}
