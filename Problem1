Question:
You are given two integer variables x and y. You need to perform the following operations:

p = x + y : Addition
q = x - y : Subtraction
r = x * y :Multiplication
s = x / y : Division
t = x % y : Modulo
Examples:

Input: x = 1, y = 2
Output: 3 -1 2 0 1 
Explanation: The given operations are performed.
Input: x = 3, y = 4 
Output: 7 -1 12 0 3 
Explanation: The given operations are performed

Solution:
class Solution 
{
    public int[] computeOperations(int x, int y) 
    {
        // code here
        int p = x + y;
        int q = x - y;
        int r = x * y;
        int s = 0;
        int t = 0;
        
        if(y != 0) {
            s = x / y;
            t = x % y;
        }
        return new int[]{p , q , r , s , t};
    }
       
}
